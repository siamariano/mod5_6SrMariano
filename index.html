         <h3>Jamming to "Fields of Gold" by Sting</h3>
         <p>You'll remember me when the west wind moves<br>
            Upon the fields of barley<br>
            You'll forget the sun in his jealous sky<br>
            As we walk in fields of gold
         </p>

         <p>So she took her love<br>
             For to gaze awhile<br>
             Upon the fields of barley<br>
             In his arms she fell as her hair came down<br>
             Among the fields of 
         </p> 
        <p>Will you stay with me, will you be my love<br>
             Among the fields of barley<br>
             We'll forget the sun in his jealous sky<br>
             As we lie in fields of gold
        </p>
